<hr />
<h3>Suzume No Tojimori</h3>
<p>Excellent background score. Hooked to the plot like any other Makoto Shinkai movie.</p>
<h3>Gantz : 0</h3>
<p>Awesome CGI and fights. Loved the boss fight.</p>
<h3>Kimetsu No Yaiba: Mugen Train</h3>
<p>Just wow. The visuals, story and fights all were on point. Was left with tears at the end. My top movie until now.</p>
